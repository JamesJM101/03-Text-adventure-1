Peer's repository: 



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 The concept of elif wasnt new to me, but the way you did it helped me understand and learn the concept a little bit better. It was clear in your code. 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

James used really good for and while loops. That is something that I still nedd to get the hang of as it is still sometimes confusing. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 The code looks good to me. A big thing I always look for is the organization of the code because it can be confusing to follow. However, the code you presented was very well organized and smooth. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 Most sections were commented properly. There weren't a whole lot of comments which could be confusing to someone who has never read code. However, it did give a gist of what the code was doing. Just make sure to comment each section. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 No not really. Most code was stuff I have seen before

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The description of what is being played is good but add some description of what exactly your code is doing within the python file for someone who has never seen code.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

This game was fun and was well put together. Honestly better put together than mine. It was interesting and had good responses to moves I made.
